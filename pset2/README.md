# Background


Each month, a credit card statement will come with the option for you to pay a minimum amount of your charge, usually 2% of the balance due. However, the credit card company earns money by charging interest on the balance that you don't pay. So even if you pay credit card payments on time, interest is still accruing on the outstanding balance.


## Problem 1:


Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month.


## Poblem 2:


Write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 months. By a fixed monthly payment, we mean a single number which does not change each month, but instead is a constant amount that will be paid each month.


## Problem 3:


Write a program that works exactly as in problem 2, but using bisection search.
